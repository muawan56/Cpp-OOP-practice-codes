# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Classes

Welcome to the C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Classes repository! This collection of C++ classes serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and applying OOP principles while addressing a variety of data types and abstract data types (ADTs). Each class is thoughtfully designed with a set of member functions, thoroughly tested with driver programs, and follows best practices for OOP in C++.

## Included Classes

1. **Rational**
    - Represents rational numbers with integer numerators and denominators.
    - Supports arithmetic operations and type casting.
    - Provides constructors, copy constructors, assignment operators, and destructors.
   
2. **Set**
    - Defines a set data structure without duplicate entries.
    - Functions for union, intersection, difference, and subset checking.
    - Constructors and operators for easy set manipulation.

3. **Bag**
    - Similar to Set but allows duplicate entries.
    - Provides the same set operations and constructors.

4. **Complex Number**
    - Represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
    - Supports arithmetic operations and formatting for output.
    - Constructors and essential operators for working with complex numbers.

5. **Matrix**
    - Represents matrices with customizable dimensions.
    - Features matrix addition, multiplication, and checks for Echelon and Reduced Echelon forms.
    - Constructors and operators for matrix operations.

6. **MyString**
    - A versatile string class with functions for substring search, case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons, word splitting, type casting, and substring replacement.
    - Constructors, assignment operators, and destructors for effective string manipulation.

## Getting Started

You can explore and use these classes in your C++ projects by following the guidelines provided in each class's dedicated driver program. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the class of your choice, e.g., `Rational`, and open its corresponding driver program, e.g., `main_rational.cpp`.

3. Compile the driver program with your C++ compiler. For example, you can compile `main_rational.cpp` using g++ with the following command:
   ```shell
   g++ main_rational.cpp -o rational_program
./rational_program
